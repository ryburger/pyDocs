Free mp3 album downloader for linux computers.
Must have python 3, youtube-dl, ffmpeg, and requests installed.
The last few lines store the music where I personally want it. So it should be removed if you have another idea.
The songs/albums metadata and file names are in camelCase, again this is a personal choice that can be easily changed.
This is rough and suffers from my rookie coding experience. 
All the heavy lifting is done by youtube-dl for getting the songs in mp4 format, and by ffmpeg for converting to mp3 files and adding metadata.
The album cover art is from wikipedia articles. So i added a quick preview image to ensure that the picture matches the cover art.
I am constantly working on this, and I hope to empower people with free music!
